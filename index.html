        <h2>Glittery Gold</h2>
        <p>Tell me right, glow up your light,
make up your mind, go behind,
and also don't lie, I'm in the way of life.
Hate it, but what you will get,
fate of mine, is there something to left?
My attitude is my poison,
my allude is my venom.
I am girly, but I am also little tomboy.
I am cute, but also I have many coy
Don't think about me or sense,
is that warning or little suspense?
Don't try to hurt my feelings,
it's sign of offense.
I don't like my phones, my phone's on hold.
If you will do it, I will be dangerly bold.
As you can see, I am the glittery gold.</p>

      <div class="poem-title">Deja Vu</div>
      <p>
        At your own front view, when dreams come true,<br>
        Everyone awaits for your review. Deja vu?<br>
        Yet nothing, but a true version of you.<br>
        Light up your mind, reflected in your eye view.<br>
        You have to look upon your case.<br>
        There are so many talks and thoughts you can't erase.<br>
        But concentrate, don't lose pace.<br>
        Trace your path in your own grace.<br>
        Consistency lifts you high to reach and fly.<br>
        Bide your fears a fond goodbye.<br>
        Embrace the challenges, way towards the sky.
