      <div class="poem-title">Glittery Gold</div>
      <p>
Tell me right, glow up your light, make up your mind, go behind, and also don't lie,<br>
I'm in the way of life. Hate it, but what you will get, fate of mine, is there something to left?<br>
My attitude is my poison, my allude is my venom.<br>
I am girly, but I am also little tomboy. I am cute, but also I have many coy.<br>
Don't think about me or sense, is that warning or little suspense?<br>
Don't try to hurt my feelings, it's sign of offense.<br>
I don't like my phones, my phone's on hold.<br>
If you will do it, I will be dangerly bold.<br>
As you can see, I am the glittery gold.

      <div class="poem-title">Deja Vu</div>
      <p>
At your own front view, when dreams come true,<br>
Everyone awaits for your review. Deja vu?<br>
Yet nothing, but a true version of you.<br>
Light up your mind, reflected in your eye view.<br>
You have to look upon your case.<br>
There are so many talks and thoughts you can't erase.<br>
But concentrate, don't lose pace.<br>
Trace your path in your own grace.<br>
Consistency lifts you high to reach and fly.<br>
Bide your fears a fond goodbye.<br>
Embrace the challenges, way towards the sky.

  <div class="poem-title">November Princess</div>
  <p>
Is that wind that blow?<br>
Here I can see sun into the snow.<br>
Now it's time for the princess glow.<br>
This November Princess is fire that can take infinite eyes.<br>
Don't try to mess with me as you are not able to see in my eyes.<br>
They are cute and red. They are flower of bloom.<br>
Don't try to hide. I have that memory that catch you just like boom.<br>
I can ignite fire as I can. You have seen this burning flame.<br>
It will not harm you. Better to be in my lane.<br>
This is seeding. This is wild. As my earring. As I smile.<br>
We have to travel. We have to go mile.<br>
It will all okay if you will follow my line.

  <div class="poem-title">November Princess Part 2</div>
  <p>
I'm a princess, no, Princess November.<br>
In my aura, your attitude will surrender.<br>
Ruthless, fearless, I never fall.<br>
Effortless, limitless, I take it all.<br>
Hold on tight, this fantasy WHITE.<br>
Riding through shadows, I conquer the night.<br>
Sweet like honey, yet fierce in my might.<br>
Soft as bunny, but sharp in my flight.<br>
Panther like dark night, but I am shining bright.<br>
Dancing in sunlight, I play my game.<br>
Revision for mission, not weak, sharpING my blades.<br>
Gold on my neck, power it is alright.<br>
Crown on my head, RULLING all night.<br>
Princess November, hurts your way.<br>
But she smiles over her prey.<br>
You are now going to swAY.<br>
Only you can do is to pray.
