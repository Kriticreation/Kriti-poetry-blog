      <div class="poem-title">Glittery Gold</div>
      <p>Tell me right, glow up your light, make up your mind, go behind, and also don't lie,
I'm in the way of life. Hate it, but what you will get, fate of mine, is there something to left?
My attitude is my poison, my allude is my venom.
I am girly, but I am also little tomboy. I am cute, but also I have many coy.
Don't think about me or sense, is that warning or little suspense?
Don't try to hurt my feelings, it's sign of offense.
I don't like my phones, my phone's on hold.
If you will do it, I will be dangerly bold.
As you can see, I am the glittery gold.</p>

    <h2>Princess November Series</h2>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="poem-title">November Princess</div>
      <p>Is that wind that blow?
Here I can see sun into the snow.
Now it's time for the princess glow.
This November Princess is fire that can take infinite eyes.
Don't try to mess with me as you are not able to see in my eyes.
They are cute and red. They are flower of bloom.
Don't try to hide. I have that memory that catch you just like boom.
I can ignite fire as I can. You have seen this burning flame.
It will not harm you. Better to be in my lane.
This is seeding. This is wild. As my earring. As I smile.
We have to travel. We have to go mile.
It will all okay if you will follow my line.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="poem-title">November Princess Part 2</div>
      <p>I'm a princess, no, Princess November.
In my aura, your attitude will surrender.
Ruthless, fearless, I never fall.
Effortless, limitless, I take it all.
Hold on tight, this fantasy WHITE.
Riding through shadows, I conquer the night.
Sweet like honey, yet fierce in my might.
Soft as bunny, but sharp in my flight.
Panther like dark night, but I am shining bright.
Dancing in sunlight, I play my game.
Revision for mission, not weak, sharpING my blades.
Gold on my neck, power it is alright.
Crown on my head, RULLING all night.
Princess November, hurts your way.
But she smiles over her prey.
You are now going to swAY.
Only you can do is to pray.</p>

    <h2>Horror Poems</h2>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="poem-title">I am the Vampire</div>
      <p>Forgetting your liars, dreaming of my hires
Screaming through nighters, between twilight you want to be miGHTER
Hold up, be aware of the fume, red velvet can give you hurtful gloom
I think you know what we consume, our crimson lace has its own perfume
Bloodstain can happen in gleam, it will haunt you extreme
Echoes of my voice with green face, no redeem
Can't you see, silver dagger regime
PlantoM, moves with pride, velvet wrapped in death delight
Scheming worthless, marble tomb eyeless
Ebony mirror says, master let silk BONE sink
And make more dream, let the people swing</p>
